# Info

Starting on September, I was able to do the courses [RH124][1] and [RH134][2] virtually.

On December 20, I'll attending to the [EX200][3] exam.

Something I have to do before is clean my notes. You can find the results on the [Markdown file][4]

December 21. The time is your worst enemy (the wrong search terms on **`man`** can take you some valuable minutes).
Luckily, I managed to get [267 points of 300][5] (you need 210 to pass).

Hope my notes helps you to pass the test (some sections may be wrong, so don't relay all your knowledge on it, try to practice).
